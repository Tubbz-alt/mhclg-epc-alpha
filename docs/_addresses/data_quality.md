**Data Quality and Cleansing.** 

1. Problems with data in the register arise from:

2. EPCs being created for the same physical property with different addresses;

3. More than one EPC being lodged in a short period of time, with no indication of the reason;

Deployments of engines at different times by different schemes, meaning that EPCs lodged at the same time may have calculations following different specifications.

**Suggested Solutions.**

1.  This could be prevented through improved address matching, to ensure that Assessors use the same address for each EPC carried out on a discrete physical property; 
and cleaned by the use of an address index, based on the UPRN. 

2. This could be for multiple reasons â€“ eg software error, an Assessor making an error, or because a property owner wants a certificate before an after a change, such as the installation of solar panels.  
Adding a field so that the assessor can give the reason for the lodgement would assist in auditing and cleaning these. 

3. In extreme cases, changes to the calculation specification can affect the Energy Performance Rating given on the certificate, so there can be inconsistencies when different engines are used at different times.  This problem could be reduced by:  

  a. having a single central engine, running on the cloud infrastructure, and 

  b. allowing researchers and others to run all input data through the same version of the engine.
