## Methodologies
* Interviews
* Unmoderated testing of prototype using embedded tracking with Hotjar
* Workshop with all user groups (citizens, assessors, data consumers)

## Number of users and roles interviewed:
* Domestic assessor (x2)
* Non-domestic assessor (x2)

## Goals
* Lodge assessment data so that energy performance certificates can be generated for clients

## Needs
**As an** energy performance assessor
**I need to** have one central location for domestic and non-domestic records 
**So that** my workflow is simplified

**As an** energy performance assessor
**I need to** be able to lodge energy assessment and generate a valid EPC report 
**So that** I can provide clients with a valid EPC report

**As an** energy performance assessor
**I need to** have only one valid address for a property
**So that** I lodge assessment data against the correct property and do not create duplicate addresses for a property

## Recommendations for Beta research
* Explore options for improving addresses and removing duplicates from the register so that the data is clearer
* Test the hypothesis of moving the opt out process for property owners to the point of assessment [This will need to be done with Schemes as well as assessors]
* Test the hypothesis of providing assessors with digital/ non digital material to pass on to clients explaining EPCs
