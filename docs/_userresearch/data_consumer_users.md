## Methodologies
* Focus groups (schemes only)
* Workshop (all user groups - citizens, data consumers, assessors)
* Interviews
* Unmoderated testing of the prototype using embedded tracking with Hotjar

## Number of users and roles interviewed:
* Devolved administration representatives (x3)
* BEIS (x4)
* Academic researchers (x2)
* MHCLG data analysts (x4)
* Scheme representative (x6)
* Property portal (x1)

## Goals
* Identify trends within EPC data
* Get a bulk view of specific properties on the register

## Needs
**As a** Local authority / devolved administrator / Registered Social landlord managing a number of properties
**I need to** know the details of the EPCs for each property 
**So that** I can comply with my legal requirement to keep them up-to-date

**As a** academic researchers / Government department / Internal data analyst 
**I need to** generate custom reports of data from the register
**So that** I can identify trends based ob my requirements

**As a** property portal
**I need to** show a valid EPC graph on an advertisement for a property 
**So that** I am compliant with my legal obligation 

**As a** Scheme representative 
**I need to** have a view of the lodgements made by one assessor across all schemes
**So that** I can conduct effective audits on their work


## Recommendations for Beta Research
* Conduct additional research with Local Authorities and Registered Social Landlords to get a better understanding of their needs
* Explore user needs for APIs
* Conduct research with Banks and Mortgage providers to analyse the potential need for them to have access to the EPC data
* Test the use of canonical URLs with property portals - does it meet their needs and are there any concerns
* Explore options for unique identifier for assessors across all schemes
