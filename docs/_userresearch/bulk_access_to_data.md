##Discovery research summary

###Findings
Tested and validated the hypothesis that citizen users will self serve information about energy certificates if it was presented clearly and included up to date information

##Findings
Goal:

Needs:
* Improve public awareness of EPCs and the EPB register 
  * Purpose of the register, data held, uses for the data
  * [Beta consideration] Review/update position in service flow
* Possibly a symptom of lack of public awareness
* Easy to find EPC data about a property
* Easy to find valid information about an assessor
* Easy to understand content
* Provide support to identified contacts for citizen users [Assisted Digital]
  * Digital leaflets and other artefacts that can be used to explain EPCs, the register, the legislation, data
