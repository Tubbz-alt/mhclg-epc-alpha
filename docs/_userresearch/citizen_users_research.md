## Discovery research summary

### Findings
* Tested and validated the hypothesis that citizen users will self serve information about energy certificates if it was presented clearly and included up to date information
* Tested and dispelled the hypothesis that citizen users need a way to opt out of having their address included in the register after it has already been added to the register.


## Discovery backlog for Alpha
Things the Discovery team identified needed to be explored during the Alpha phase:

* Research with Energy Savings Trust
* Research with potential users of the APIs
* Investigate ‘Consent’ with citizen users
* Find out how to integrate with BEIS calculators
* Further research with estate agents
* Publicise availability of EPC information (??)
* Investigate ways to secure access to view own information
* Run a survey with users to discover appetite to access and use own energy performance data
* Investigate incorporating EPCs into a ‘Property logbook’

## Citizen user research
User roles:
* Property owners
* Buyer
* Seller
* Tenant
* Estate agent
* Letting agent

## Goals
* Find an EPC report for a property
* Find an assessor to do an EPC assessment on a property
