## Methodologies
* Interviews
* Unmoderated testing of prototype using embedded tracking with Hotjar 
* Workshop with all user groups (citizens, assessors, data consumers)

## Number of users and roles interviewed:
* Property owners (x2)
* Tenant (x3)
* Landlord (x2)
* Estate agent / letting agent (x1)

## Goals
* Find an up-to-date EPC report for a property
* Find an assessor to do an EPC assessment on a property

## Needs
**As a** property owner
**I need to** be informed about what EPCs are and why they are needed 
**So that** I can make informed decisions about an EPC for my property

**As a** property owner
**I need to** find a valid EPC for a property if one exists 
**So that** I can legally sell or rent that property

**As an** Estate / letting agent marketing a property for sale or rent 
**I need to** have a direct link to a valid EPC for a specific property 
**So that** I know that the EPC rating being displayed in the listing is valid

**As a** property owner renting or selling a property
**I need to** locate a competent energy performance assessor
**So that** I can legally sell or rent that property

## Barriers
* Litlle to no knowledge about EPCs beyond the need to get one as part of the process when selling or renting a property
* Little or no understanding of EPC terminology
* Little or no knowledge of how to choose an appropriate energy performance assessor

## Recommendations for Beta research
* Test content to inform the citizen user group about energy performance certificates
* Explore the idea of providing leaflets or a digital wiki of key facts about EPCs to help inform citizens
* Explore the proposition of moving the consent/opt out decision to the point at which the assessment is conducted
