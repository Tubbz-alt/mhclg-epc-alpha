<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Addresses</h2>


As part of this alpha we researched how addresses are used in the service and how this sits within the wider MHCLG landscape. Assessments are carried out on existing buildings as well as new buildings sometimes on-plan prior to ground being broken.

A bespoke address database has been created and populated over the past 12 years as part of the provisioning and delivery of the EPB service. This address database contains all the addresses where an EPC has been recorded. 

Our research with assessors and scheme representatives identified issues with this bespoke address database primarily around address duplication, data quality and back office processes - specifically the requesting, validating and adding of new addresses. 

Our research with data consumers including MHCLG data analysts identified a lack of linkability of EPC data with other data sets by address - specifically caused by the bespoke unique property reference number not being linked to other standard property reference numbers such as the NLPG’s UPRN (National Land and Property Gazeteer’s Unique Property Reference Number).

We met with a number of MHCLG staff as well as Geoplace and Ordnance Survey to get a better picture of the address lifecycle, data owners and the roadmap around products and services available under Government licences such as the Public Sector Mapping Agreement and how EPB is affected. We tested and validated approaches to address matching to get a better understanding of common challenges and how EPB could be affected.

There are a number of recommended improvements around addresses, over the short term; we recommend improvements to the ‘request a new address’ process required by assessors. Implementing a simpler experience and interface that provides clearer more trustworthy results to assessors - essentially better address search results incorporating a validated base address source such as the NLPG that prevents the unnecessary requesting of new addresses. Additionally cleansing and matching across the existing address database is recommended to sort out the current duplication and associated data quality issues.

The longer term recommendations are for MHCLG to create and provide an address service that enables services to search for an address, request a new address to be added and links addresses across services via an address index. We recognise that linkable addresses and addressing data is a bigger picture conversation that is greater than any one service so these longer term recommendations sit outside of EPB with a view of EPB eventually becoming a consumer of the address service.
