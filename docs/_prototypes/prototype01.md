This prototype covers public access to the register for public service users. Building on the wireframes from the discovery phase, it provides routes for users to: find an existing report; find an assessor; and opt out (or opt in) to the register. It also includes links to useful additional information about the service.

The prototype was revised based on user feedback and expert review, with the user flow changed to follow GDS patterns. The site design was iterated over consistently during the course of the Alpha phase, with 58 iterations being deployed to Heroku. 

One idea included in the prototype was the provision of canonical urls for the certificate, including a separate URL for the energy chart in order to allow it to be included directly in third party sites. 

Another key idea was the removal of the whole opt-in/out flow based on user feedback as this was felt to be unnecessary (an area to explore in beta with policy and legal).

Additional improvements suggest but not implemented included a more detailed flow to identify/check assessors; and the combination of commercial and domestic results.
