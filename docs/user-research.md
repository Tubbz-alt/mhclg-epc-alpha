  * Software provider
  * Service provider [Domestic assessor, Non-domestic assessor, Scheme representatives]


## Methodology
### Research
Two workshops were also conducted to validate and prioritise user needs - one for scheme representatives and one for all user groups.


The needs, combined with business requirements, were used to influence the prototypes designed.  The prototype was then embedded with tracking which allowed the project team to track how participants interacted with it.
