* Identify trends in the EPC data

## What we did
* 27 interviews, 45mins long with citizen users, data users and assessors
* Focus group with scheme representatives
* Workshop with representatives from all groups (Citizens, Data, Assessor)
* Embedded tracking in prototype [Hotjar]

Over the course of the project there were several iterations on the prototype. The following hypotheses were tested and iterated on:

### Citizen
* Discovery designs as a working prototype
* Find a report
* Opt out journey
* Canonical url for assessors, reports and EPC graph 

### Assessor
* Merging the domestic and non-domestic records
* Smart search results - filtering and sorting of results
* Accessibility validations
* Lodgement process
* Smart search
