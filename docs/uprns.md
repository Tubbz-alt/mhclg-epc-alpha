The Universal Property Reference Number (UPRN) is allocated to buildings by Local Authorities, who have the statutory authority to name and number every street and property in their area.  In some cases, a UPRN may be assigned by the Ordnance Survey, who identify “objects in the landscape” that might not otherwise have an address (buildings such as agricultural barns and sheds, or bothies in highland areas).  UPRNs are centrally managed and allocated by Geoplaces.  Their guidance states that a UPRN should be assigned to a building either when construction commences or when street naming and numbering is carried out, which ever happens first.  

In practice, it can take up to 2 months from the generation of an Energy Performance Certificate for a new-build residence to the time when a UPRN is assigned. This is because the certificate for a new-build is generated using the SAP methodology, which is desk based and uses the building plans, rather than visiting the building.

As a result, of this delay, Landmark have assigned a unique identifier Business Reference Number in place of the UPRN for new addresses. These unique identifiers have been named the UPRN in the data set.  

**Can this be rectified?**

Whatever is done, the timelag between assigning the certificate and the UPRN for a new-build will remain, so the BRN should be retained as an identifier for the address to cover this period.

We recommend creating an Address Index (see other documents) in the course of the Beta project.  This will associate EPC records in the register with the correct, local authority assigned, UPRN.  This will link together all the different versions of the address referring to a physical property, and allow linking to other data set without having to use additional address matching.
