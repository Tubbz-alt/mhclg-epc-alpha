As a part of this alpha we prototyped and iterated **16 user journeys**; 8 high-level and 8 detailed to meet identified user needs. These user journeys were combined into two core service offerings; one for **service users** and one for **service providers and data consumers**. Research with data consumers validated the requirement for RESTful APIs and JSON (aligned with Government Service Standards), we further validated the usage of APIs to drive the services recommended for GOV.UK by building some of our prototypes on top of the EPB Open Data Service APIs.

More details about each prototype can be found by following the relevant link.
