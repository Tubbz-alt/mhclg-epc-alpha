<h1 class="govuk-heading-m">Overview</h1>

A total of **24, 45 minute-long interviews were conducted over the project**. The users interviewed were selected based on the Discovery work conducted as well as initial research at the beginning of the Alpha project. These users were:
* Domestic assessors
* Non-domestic assessors
* Scheme representatives
* Representatives from Northern Ireland (Devolved administration)
* BEIS representatives
* Academic researchers
* Data analysts from MHCLG
* Property owners
* Landlords
* Property developers
* Software providers

From this research it was possible to group the users by needs and goals into the following groups:
* **Data consumer** [BEIS, Academic users, MHCLG Data analysts, Local Authorities, Devolved administration]
* **Service user** [Property owners, Landlords, Tenants]
* **Software provider** 
* **Service provider** [Domestic assessor, Non-domestic assessor, Scheme representatives]

The needs, combined with business requirements, were used to influence the prototypes designed. The prototype was then embedded with tracking which allowed the project team to track how participants interacted with it.

Two workshops were also conducted to validate and prioritise user needs - one for scheme representatives and one for all user groups.

NB. Attempts were made to contact the following users but no response was received:
* Mortgage brokers
* Local authorities (England)
