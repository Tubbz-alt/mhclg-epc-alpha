        The register includes energy performance certificates for residential and non-residential buildings, display energy
        certificates for public authority buildings, and air conditioning inspection reports for air conditioning systems
        over 12kW.

        An energy performance certificate is required for properties when constructed, sold or let. The energy performance
        certificate provides details on the energy performance of the property and what you can do to improve it.

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Almost 40% of the UK’s energy consumption and carbon emissions come from the way our buildings are lit, heated
        and used. Even comparatively small changes in energy performance and the way we use each building will have a
        significant effect in reducing total energy consumption.</p>
