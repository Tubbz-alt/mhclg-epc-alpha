In the 2018 [Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-review-of-building-regulations-and-fire-safety-final-report) there is a recommendation that there is a 'digital record' for buildings. We are working with the Building Safety Programme to understand what a 'digital record' might look like, and how the data could be collected and made available.
