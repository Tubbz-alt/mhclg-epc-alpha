Land located close to airports and flight paths may be subject to aircraft noise. This noise is classified in three ways:

* Mechanical noise — rotation of the engine parts, most noticeable when fan blades reach supersonic speeds
* Aerodynamic noise — from the airflow around the surfaces of the aircraft, especially when flying low at high speeds
* Noise from aircraft systems — cockpit and cabin pressurization and conditioning systems, and Auxiliary Power units

The [Aviation Policy Framework] (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/153776/aviation-policy-framework.pdf) outlines planning considerations with regards to aircraft noise.
