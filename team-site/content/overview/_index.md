The priorities for the Energy Performance Certificate Alpha are -->





Prototyping an improved design - based on the user research and wireframes from the Discovery and our own continuing user research - making use of GOV.UK patterns and tooling.

**Outcome: Tested, end to end prototype using the GOV.UK design patterns**


Technical investigation and options report to ensure there is sufficient understanding of the challenges, risks and opportunities for the Beta build and data migration. This will include understanding of data quality and tactics to move to a modern, cloud infrastructure (that is both financially sustainable and flexible for future needs.*)

**Outcome: Detailed DOS opportunity that provides any potential Beta supplier with sufficient information to understand the requirements and in particular the challenges and risks from a digital, data and technology perspective.**


Experiments and prototypes for approaches to making data access more flexible and accessible to different users (initially Gov users - BEIS, Local Government, Devolved Admins) taking into account data privacy at each level. Considering how users need to access and use the data (is it via API, bulk download, custom download for adding to Excel models, online dashboards) and fine grained access controls and disclosure controls.

**Outcome: Series of prototypes illustrating approaches and research findings at each stage.**



### AT EVERY POINT WE ARE INVESTIGATING THE USER NEEDS OF:

- Citizen users of the service
- Government users of the data
- Assessors experience of the service


### WE REFERENCE THE SERVICE STANDARD AT ALL POINTS

*we need to properly understand the current ‘cost per transaction’ here as well
