We have created a number of shortcodes that can be used when writing markdown. These shortcodes will create styled components.

We have also written so brief guides on how to create the different content types. The guides we have are:

* [Project pages](CREATING_PROJECT_PAGES.md)

### Inset text

Replicates [govuk inset text component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/inset-text/).

Usage:
```
{{% inset-text %}}
We do not allow Google to use or share our analytics data.
{{% /inset-text %}}
```

### in-progress-issue block

These are used on the project pages. We use it to highlight which issue we are currently working on and any progress we have made.

It takes 2 arguments:

* title - which should be the title as on github issues
* number - which is the issue number on github

You are then free to put any other sections within the block. For example on the **[Developer contributions project](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/)** we have 3 sections: "Questions we're asking", "What we tested" and "What we learned."

Usage:
```
{{< in-progress-issue title="Checking developer contribution data is valid" number="32" >}}
#### Section titles within the block

Some text, etc

{{< /in-progress-issue >}}
```

### Technical block

Used to highlight a command to run, a expected format or how to name a file.

Usage:
```
{{< tech-block >}}local-authority:nfk{{< /tech-block >}}
```

### Transclusion

There is a shortcode available that allows you to transclude content from a different markdown file. You can use this to break content down into reusable chunks.

Usage:
```
{{% include-content "develop-a-common-data-format.md" "common-format-section" %}}
```

It takes 2 arguments:

* Arg1 - path to the .md file
* Arg2 - class to add to the block
